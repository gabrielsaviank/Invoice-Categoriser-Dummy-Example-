# Eesti Invoice Categoriser

### This is a Machine Learning application for categorising invoices according to the Estonian accounting laws
### You can check more here: [Estonian Chart of accounts](https://www.smartaccounts.eu/uuskodu2015/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skeem-1_chart_of_accounts.pdf)

### This is a rewritten version of the TensorFlow application, it's solely to compare both frameworks. To check which one fits better for Generative AI in the future.

Since our purpose is to evaluate accuracy between both frameworks the data is inputted manually. 

## Tools used 

* Python 3.10
* Numpy
* PyTorch


### Improvements: 

Soon I'll create a docker No-SQL database for training and adding the samples easier
